# UPT_ML

**Intro to ML course at the Polytechnic University of Tirana (Albania)**

Raul Benitez, Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain)

Contact: raul.benitez@upc.edu

**Contents:**

1. Exploratory data analysis (data handling and visualization, imputation strategies) 
2. Clustering algorithms (k-means, agglomerative clustering, Gaussian Mixture models)
3. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
4. Supervised classification models (kNN, discriminant analysis, decision trees)
5. Performance evaluation (performance scores, train/test, k-fold cross-validation)

**Course Evaluation** 

Develop a project with data from either Kaggle or UCI datasets: 

https://www.kaggle.com/

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets

The project should include: data loading, handling, data imputation (if needed), visualization, PCA analysis, clustering and a classification/regression model and the corresponding performance measures. 
The deliverable should be an interactive Python Notebook (.ipynb) with detailed 
explanation of the different steps and comments analyzing the obtained results. 
Make sure you upload both the notebook and the pdf in a folder with your full name to the following shared folder:
